1	antifa doesn't beat facsists to try to get them to change their mind - they know it's a lost cause to try to change a fascist's mind. they do it to scare them into hiding, to demoralize them, and to stop the spread of their hateful ideology. there is no forcing views on others"."

0	revkin spreading important news."?????????????? andy sees himself as an intellectual 2. this is what us real liberals r stuck with from public figures. then the faux liberals-like andy-wonder why we real liberals dont care anymore."
1	i'm assuming that is a proponent of gun control. the argument for gun control is the threat of being shot. she then goes on to accuse people who open or conceal carry of being scared of a hypothetical fear of being shot. it's a hypocritical statement
1	eric holder should be in prison !!

1	he will blame it on the fact that he is hispanic of course.
1	only if you want a murder charge. stealing guns is already a felony. shooting someone with their own gun is life in prison at best. there is just no way this ends well for whoever tries this. i honestly think this is a troll made by 4chan to get stupid antifa members shot/jailed.

0	the vast majority of counterprotestors were normal cville residents. there were a few antifa and a few blm people. all violence was instigated initially by the white supremacists. antifa protected clergy members and black residents.
0	conservatives characterize an attempted rape allegation as “bullsh*t” then wonder why liberals describe them as anti-woman. the right thing to do is properly investigate the allegation. if she lying then prosecute her. if she’s telling the truth kavanaugh shouldn’t be confirmed.

1	not only the antifa got quite alot israel supporters. you'll find israeli flags at the right winger protest just as well. oh the irony
0	that's a simplistic comparison. population density and poverty levels are big contributors. you need a massive cultural shift and constitutional amendments for gun control to be effective like in other countries. in the mean time people will keep dying.
0	and they aiming right way you whooo whooo !
1	as of right now my only solid position is that the nra has become far too influential in politics and as a result they have delayed the desire for gun control for about 20 years.

0	god bless my uncle has cancer too but she is in a better place now
1	causality? is it: 1. chicago lawmakers instituted strict guncontrol because of high pre-existing crime rate? 2. crime rate is high because strict gun control prevents law abiding citizens to be armed - so only scofflaws have guns? 3. no causality at all. statistics are cohort
1	he’s a nut job and to republicans thinking he will support your “let kids be murdered in school” policy he says emma gonzalez is his idol who is a gun control advocate so don’t be fooled unless you want liberal policies. (personally i do but what the hell)

1	this terrorist fanboy and his saddo cronies are wholly unfit to hold any public office. a proper brexit supporting tory pm would have wiped them out politically by now.
0	did you forget about the 7 years of war previous? or perhaps the economic crash of 2008 and all of it's consequences? maybe you need to be reminded of all the stonewalling by congress on any attempts of gun control by the obama administration?
0	at this point it’s like saying it’s “too soon to talk about gun control” after a school shooting. there isn’t any “too soon” anymore with gun control or climate change at the rate that things are effecting us.
0	much of the data" being put out by gun control groups is false and misleading. needlessly scaring parents is not helpful at a personal or policy level, as this suny report illusterates.
